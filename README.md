## About me

I am a very determined and rational person and I like to set goals to maintain my focus.
I am somewhat independent, but I also work well in a team, as I did in my previous experiences where I got along very well with
my colleagues and even helped them when they had certain difficulties that I managed well.
In these experiences I also developed ability to listen and understand customer problems to find the best way to solve them.
